<h1>📊 Sales Forecasting for E-commerce Transactions</h1>

<h3>🚀 Project Overview</h3>
This project focuses on predicting e-commerce sales using machine learning techniques. We implement Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression to analyze historical sales data and forecast future sales trends.

<h3>📁 Dataset</h3>
The dataset contains transactional data, including: 

Store	Date  
Weekly_Sales  
Holiday_Flag  
Temperature  
Fuel_Price  
CPI	Unemployment  
Postal Code  

<h3>🏗️ Tech Stack</h3>  

Programming Language: Python  
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
Machine Learning Models:  
Random Forest Regression  
XG Boost Regression  
Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R² Score  

<h3>📊 Model Training & Evaluation</h3>   

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.  
Model Training: Training Random Forest and XG Boost models.    
Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid Search and Cross-validation for optimization.    
Evaluation: Models are evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R² Score.    

<h3>📈 Results</h3>  

Random Forest Regression achieved R² Score = 0.97.  
XG Boosting Regression achieved R² Score = 0.98.
