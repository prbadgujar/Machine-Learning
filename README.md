📊 Sales Forecasting for E-commerce Transactions

🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting e-commerce sales using machine learning techniques. We implement Random Forest Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression to analyze historical sales data and forecast future sales trends.

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains transactional data, including:
Store	Date
Weekly_Sales
Holiday_Flag
Temperature
Fuel_Price
CPI	Unemployment	
Postal Code
